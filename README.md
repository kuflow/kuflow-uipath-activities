# KuFlow.UiPathLibrary

Set of UiPath activities to interact with KuFlow.



## Summary

A library to help process developers on KuFlow (kuflow.com) to use robots developed in UiPath as part of their workflow implementations. A set of useful activities are distributed to interact with the KuFlow Rest API from a robot.

## Overview

The KuFlow.UiPathLibrary package consists of a pack of UiPath activities to work with KuFlow.
The activity pack allows robot developers to interact with the KuFlow Rest API in a simple and convenient way, allowing Robots to be modelled in UiPath as part of KuFlow processes.
Activities provide different ways to enter, modify or delete relevant information generated in the robots, in the tasks that make up KuFlow processes. Similarly, utilities are also provided to reclaim tasks in the processes among other functionalities.
In short, if you want to use a UiPath robot as part of the workflow of your processes, in order to work in a coordinated way in its resolution, this library will help you to achieve your goal.

## Features

- Allows you to manage task data (add, delete, delete).
- Reclaiming tasks.
